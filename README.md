## To install the frontend dependencies

```
cd backend
npm i
```

## Running the project

You will need to configure the .env file and run the sql queries in order to initialize the database and such. The sample for the .env file is provided. The port for the backend server is hardcoded to port 4000, so it would be the best to use Port 4000 to not run into any issues.

## Steps

```
cd backend
npm start

cd ..

cd frontend
npm start
```
